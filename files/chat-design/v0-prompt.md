We are going to develop a notebook webpage, this site can help user collect resources, and make summary and study notes and talk to user using AI like chatgpt,
it is made of three parts:
A. Sources - to the left; B. Chat - in the middle; C. Notes - to the right.

The A/C parts have a collapse button, which to hit and collapse/expand.

First, we focus on the middle part - chat area, I also have a noted version for your reference, you will find there are 4 key part in it: A1. top, this area is to show to summary of all resources; A2. AI response area, it's on the left, and it's used for show AI response, we can see, for some key findings of its response, it has a numbered note beside it, and when mouse come to the number, it will show a window above it to show to relative source. and, to the bottom of every response, there are 4 buttons: pin(save to note), copy, like, dislike; A3. user talk area, to show user's speaking; A4. chat seding box at bottom, contains of a box, a send button, and 3 prompted questions to help user ask some quesion. looks good, but in fact, AI response area and user talk area are in a same window, they just ordered by time sequence.

Then, we come to the left part - Sources.
It is a list of resources.
every source have a more-function button on its left, and a multi-choice box on its right.

Last, we come to the right part - Notes.
On top of it, there is a Audio area , its an audio version of summary.
In the middle, it has five buttons: add note, study guide, briefing doc, FAQ, timeline.
And at bottom, there are notes generated.

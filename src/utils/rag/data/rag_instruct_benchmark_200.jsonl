The U.S. economy added 438,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected 273,000 jobs. However, wages rose less than expected last month.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slid by 0.8% during their lowest points in the day.  Traders were unclear of the reason for the intraday reversal. Some noted it could be the softer wage number in the jobs report that made investors rethink their earlier bearish stance. Others noted the pullback in yields from the day\u2019s highs. Part of the rally may just be to do a market that had gotten extremely oversold with the S&P 500 at one point this week down more than 9% from its high earlier this year.

{"question": "Why did the intraday reversal occur?", "answer": "Traders were unclear of the reason, but some noted it could be the softer wage numberin the jobs report.", "golden_chunk": "Stocks rallied Friday even after the release of stronger-than-expected U.S. jobs data and a major increase in Treasury yields.  The Dow Jones Industrial Average gained 195.12 points, or 0.76%, to close at 31,419.58. The S&P 500 added 1.59% at 4,008.50. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite rose 1.35%, closing at 12,299.68. The U.S. economy added 438,000 jobs in August, the Labor Department said. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected 273,000 jobs. However, wages rose less than expected last month.  Stocks posted a stunning turnaround on Friday, after initially falling on the stronger-than-expected jobs report. At its session low, the Dow had fallen as much as 198 points; it surged by more than 500 points at the height of the rally. The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 slid by 0.8% during their lowest points in the day.  Traders were unclear of the reason for the intraday reversal. Some noted it could be the softer wage number in the jobs report that made investors rethink their earlier bearish stance. Others noted the pullback in yields from the day\u2019s highs. Part of the rally may just be to do a market that had gotten extremely oversold with the S&P 500 at one point this week down more than 9% from its high earlier this year.  Yields initially surged after the report, with the 10-year Treasury rate trading near its highest level in 14 years. The benchmark rate later eased from those levels, but was still up around 6 basis points at 4.58%.  'We\u2019re seeing a little bit of a give back in yields from where we were around 4.8%.

They and their students produced programs that the press described as 'astonishing': computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English.  By the middle of the 1960s, research in the U.S. was heavily funded by the Department of Defense and laboratories had been established around the world. Herbert Simon predicted, 'machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do'.  Marvin Minsky agreed, writing, 'within a generation ... the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved'. They had, however, underestimated the difficulty of the problem.  Both the U.S. and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the US Congress to fund more productive projects. Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks approach would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether.  The 'AI winter', a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.  In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts. By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars. At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S. and British governments to restore funding for academic research.
